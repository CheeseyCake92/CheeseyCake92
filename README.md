### Funny bio
Pronouns: She/Her

I'm usually more active on Discord: CheeseyCake92

----------------------------------------------------------
Since Github allows you to do funny markdown stuff with a far higher character limit, here's my actual about me.

I mostly use this branch of accounts for ERP and NSFW purposes(No IRL pictures or videos. I neither am comfortable with that, or have enough self confidence for that)
**If you find NSFW content/ERP uncomfortable or are a minor, you should look elsewhere**

I only really find females attractive. Sooo, If you're gonna ERP with me, I'd prefer if you RP as female

I like coding, I sometimes draw and I sometimes like to ERP

I'm usually online between 1:00(AM) to 5:00(AM) Eastern Standard Time

My profile picture is a modified screenshot from Starbound because I'm too lazy to make a proper profile picture

I'm one of those weirdos that like in-engine Minecraft NSFW content. Although more than just a skin, vanilla NSFW skins are pretty boring
