### Funny bio
Pronouns: She/Her

I'm usually more active on Discord: CheeseyCake92
> [!CAUTION] 
> **If you find NSFW content and ERP uncomfortable or are a minor, you should look elsewhere. If you HAVE to contact me, plainly specify that you have no interest for NSFW content**


----------------------------------------------------------
Since Github allows you to do funny markdown stuff with a far higher character limit, here's a bunch of random things about me

I mostly use this branch of accounts for ERP and NSFW purposes (No IRL pictures or videos. I am neither comfortable with that, nor do I have enough self confidence for that)


I only really find women attractive. So if you're gonna ERP with me, I'd prefer if you RP as a woman

I like coding, I sometimes draw, I sometimes like to ERP, I sometimes like to make nsfw content using code :3

I'm usually online between 1:00(AM) to 5:00(AM) Eastern Standard Time

My profile picture is a modified screenshot from Starbound because I'm too lazy to make a proper profile picture

I'm one of those weirdos that like in-engine Minecraft NSFW content using something like Figura. Although more than just a skin, vanilla NSFW skins are pretty boring
